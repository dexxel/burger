## Node - Express - Handlebars - MySQL - Heroku 

An app that allows a user to build a custom burger, provide a name for it, and store the information in a database. Using JQuery, I was able to toggle images to show the burger as it is being built, and using Boostrap's modals, I query the database to display a list of ingredients of previously stored submissions.
